Introduction
---

I chose to clone a DAVIDsTEA email because, well, I like tea (lol). Also, putting together simple layouts like this is what would be expected when developing emails, so the more practice, the better.

I did both the English and French version of the email.

Methodology
---

On the email, I clicked to view the email on a separate screen. I extracted the images using the program [Eagle](https://eagle.cool/), fixed up the Logos in Photoshop (get rid of the white background), and went to the main website to get the color code for the main green colour.

Tools I Used
---
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-First Design

Items for further study
---

I noticed when looking at the email via Dev Tools, they used a Table to place the items. Next time I build a promo email clone, I'll give putting items in a table a shot.
